# openjdk-support

This repository is used to track issues raised by end-users against the
adoptopenjdk binaries.

Previously the adoptopenjdk builds directed people to raise such issues
against the [openjdk-build](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-build)
repository. Most issues from there will be transferred to this repository
instead.

Templates are available for raising issues.
