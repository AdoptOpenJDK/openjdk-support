# adoptium-support

This repository is used to track issues raised by end-users against the
adoptopenjdk binaries.

Previously the adoptopenjdk builds directed people to raise such issues
against the [openjdk-build](https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-build)
repository. Most issues from there will be transferred to this repository
instead.

Templates are available for raising issues.

## Triaging Issues

Our bug reporting templates will ask you to also test your issue against an upstream binary or one by an alterantive provider.

During our attempt to triage the issue with you at AdoptOpenJDK, if we discover that it's an upstream issue then we'll report it upstream on your behalf or in some cases ask you to do so.

## Issues that are OpenJDK or OpenJ9 upstream issues

It's important to note that AdoptOpenJDK is a binary provider and that source code fixes happen at [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net) or at [Eclipse OpenJ9](https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/).

## Community Support

There is free (best efforts) based support via our Slack community which you can join at https://adoptopenjdk.net/slack.html.

## Commercial Support

Some companies provide commercial support for AdoptOpenJDK binaries.  See https://adoptopenjdk.net/support.html for more details.
