## Summary

<!--
A brief summary of the problem.
-->

## Steps to reproduce

<!--
All bug reports must have steps to reproduce. Otherwise, we cannot work on it! A
crash dump is not sufficient!

Please provide a minimal, reproducible example that we can run locally. See
https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example for what that means.
A public GitHub repository works best. See
https://github.com/aahlenst/datetimeformatter-parse-bug for a live example.
